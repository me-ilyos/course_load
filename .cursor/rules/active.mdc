# Active Development: Custom User Model

# Current Active Development

## Authentication System Implementation

Currently implementing the authentication system for the Course Load application:

- Created custom User model with three user types (Academic Admin, Department Head, Professor)
- User authentication is now possible through username (as requested) with email uniqueness enforcement
- Role-based permissions framework established through user type field

The modified User model is ready for migrations.

Currently implementing admin interface:
- Created CustomUserAdmin that extends Django's UserAdmin
- Added user_type to list_display, list_filter, and fieldsets
- Customized add_fieldsets to include email and user_type during user creation

Currently implementing authentication views and templates:
- Created login view with role-based redirection
- Created dashboard templates for each user type
- Implemented authorization checks for each dashboard view
- Set up URL routing for the authentication system
- Added login/logout functionality

Currently implementing department and professor models:
- Created Department model with title, code, and department head fields
- Created Professor model linked to User model with department association
- Added admin interfaces for both models
- Implemented logic to update user type when assigning department head
- Updated Professor model with employment type and degree holder fields
- Created management command to generate dummy users, departments, and professors with Marvel and DC characters

Next steps will involve:
1. Creating migrations for the models
2. Running the dummy data command
3. Setting up role-based permissions throughout the application
4. Implementing specific features for each dashboard

Implementing and testing Excel parsing for curriculum uploads in the curricula app. Extracting major type, duration, and education type from the first sheet of the uploaded Excel file, and outputting the parsed data to the console for verification. Added a test endpoint at /curricula/parse-excel/.

Added a basic HTML template for uploading Excel files (curricula/upload_excel.html), and updated the view to render this template for GET requests.

Currently implementing and testing parsing of mandatory course codes and titles from the curriculum Excel file in the curricula app. This includes updating the parsing logic to extract a list of mandatory courses (code and title) and returning them in the parsed data dictionary.

Currently creating a base HTML template (`department.html`) for the Department Head UI using Bootstrap and CSS. This template includes sections for department summary, course allocation, and professor workload overview.

Refined the `department.html` template to enhance its professional appearance. Added a fixed Bootstrap navbar, a sticky footer, incorporated Bootstrap Icons for visual cues, and improved overall styling with subtle shadows, better font, and spacing adjustments.

Implemented a sidebar navigation layout for `department.html`. This includes a fixed left sidebar for main navigation, a main content area with a top bar (for breadcrumbs and user info), and an updated footer. CSS was heavily modified to support this new structure.

Implemented a collapsible sidebar feature for `department.html`. This includes a toggle button, CSS for collapsed/expanded states with animations, and JavaScript to handle the toggle and persist the state using localStorage.

Created `base.html` by generalizing `department.html`. Refined the sidebar toggle button style. Updated `department.html` to extend `base.html`, using Django template blocks for page-specific content, title, breadcrumbs, and user information.

Styled the `apps/core/templates/core/login.html` page. Implemented a centered layout with Bootstrap, styled form elements with floating labels, used Bootstrap alerts for messages/errors, and added branding.

Updated project name to NAMDTU in `apps/core/templates/core/login.html`. Awaiting clarification from user regarding a problem in a view.

Translated static text in `apps/core/templates/core/login.html` to Uzbek. Set HTML lang attribute to 'uz'. Reviewed and handled placeholder tags. Added minor CSS fix for floating label autofill.

Updated `apps/core/templates/core/academic_admin_dashboard.html` to extend `base.html`. Translated all static text to Uzbek, styled actions using Bootstrap cards with icons, and defined necessary template blocks.
