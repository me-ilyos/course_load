# Excel document structure

[DI.xlsx](mdc:.cursor/rules/DI.xlsx) consider this working curriculum document. It has general information about the course. ALWAYS parse first sheet of the workbook. Be careful with parsing values are merged in cells. 

These are:

- Major type (Akademik Daraja): BAKALAVR
- Major Duration (O'qish muddati): 4 yil
- Type of education (Ta'lim shakli): Kunduzgi
- Major code + title: 60610400 - Dasturiy injiniring.

Then we need to extract mandatory courses that a major has. The mandatory course always starts with a row that has a cell value "1.01", this row is the first mandatory course. The other courses are in subsequent rows. After that identifying cell we have course code and course title





In some curriculum documents they can be in other parts.
