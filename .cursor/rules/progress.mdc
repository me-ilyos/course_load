# Project Progress

## Authentication System

### Custom User Model (2023-07-10)

- Implemented a custom user model in `apps/core/models.py` that extends Django's `AbstractUser`.
- The model supports three user types:
  - Academic Affairs Office Admin
  - Department Head
  - Professor
- Authentication is done using the username field, while maintaining email uniqueness.
- Custom `UserManager` was created to support user and superuser creation with both username and email.
- Helper methods added to easily check user types:
  - `is_academic_admin()`
  - `is_department_head()`
  - `is_professor()`
- Updated Django settings to use the custom user model by adding `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'core.User'` in `config/settings.py`.

The custom User model provides the foundation for role-based access control throughout the application. Department Head role is assigned to professors who lead departments.

### Admin Interface for User Model (2023-07-11)

- Implemented `CustomUserAdmin` in `apps/core/admin.py` that extends Django's `UserAdmin`
- Customized the admin interface to display and filter by user types
- Created specialized fieldsets that include the user_type field
- Added user_type to the user creation form
- Made `date_joined` and `last_login` read-only to avoid admin errors

### Authentication Views and Templates (2023-07-12)

- Created login view in `apps/core/views.py` that redirects users based on their type
- Implemented dashboard templates for each user type:
  - Academic Affairs Office Admin (`academic_admin_dashboard.html`)
  - Department Head (`department_head_dashboard.html`) 
  - Professor (`professor_dashboard.html`)
- Added role-based access control to ensure users can only access appropriate dashboards
- Set up URL configuration in `apps/core/urls.py` for authentication endpoints
- Integrated with Django's authentication system for login/logout functionality

### Department and Professor Models (2023-07-15)

- Created `Department` model in `apps/departments/models.py` with:
  - Title field for department name
  - Code field for unique department code
  - Department head OneToOneField linked to User model
  - Auto-updating department head user type on save
- Created `Professor` model in `apps/professors/models.py` with:
  - OneToOneField to User model for base user data
  - ForeignKey to Department for department association
  - Additional fields for employee ID and academic title
  - Employment type field with fractional options (0.25 to 2.0)
  - Boolean field for tracking doctoral degree holders
- Implemented admin interfaces in respective admin.py files with:
  - Optimized querysets using select_related
  - Custom display methods for better admin experience
  - Appropriate filters and search fields
- Added management command in `apps/core/management/commands/create_dummy_data.py` to:
  - Create departments for different academic disciplines
  - Generate professor users with Marvel and DC character names
  - Assign department heads automatically from professors with doctoral degrees
  - Set up an academic admin user
